# Minifi

Minifi is a URL shortening service!
There is a lot of work that has been made and I would like to publish it for anyone to use!

# Information

## Requirements

- [x] Node
- [x] NPM

## The API

The API supports basic CRUD operations!

## The Client

The Client uses VUE.JS which is a cool JS framework!

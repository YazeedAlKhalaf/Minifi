### iOS

I don't have the binaries, but you can build it for yourself!

## How to use :thinking:

1. You must have Flutter installed and working on your development machine.
2. Install all packages by running `flutter pub get` in the project's directory to get all required packages.
3. Run your app with `flutter run`!
